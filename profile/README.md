## üéØ¬†TLDR: everything you should know about Jukto

> Empowering teams to turn data into actionable decisions at scale.

In today's business world, `data` is ubiquitous and serves as a critical success metric. However, when insights are fragmented across disconnected tools, delayed, or inaccessible, teams often face challenges navigating between SQL, Python, BI platforms, and reporting workflows. This fragmentation leads to slow decision-making and creates operational bottlenecks.

**Jukto** (Bengali for *`connected`*) is on a mission to change that. We're building an **AI-native Self-Serve Collaborative Data Platform** that is designed to unify fragmented workflows into a single, AI-native layer to **connect, analyze, visualize, automate, and collaborate**. Think of it as "`Palantir For Data Teams`".

Palantir proved what‚Äôs possible when data and decisions come together. But Foundry is closed and out of reach for most. Jukto democratizes that power: an accessible, flexible data OS built for transparency, trust, and collaboration between humans and AI.

**Vision: Why Jukto Exists**

Most of the modern enterprises/organizations spend millions on disconnected analytics tools, reporting, and more. It leads teams and analysts to struggle and spend more time wrangling data than making decisions. Most of the traditional BI dashboards and notebooks are static, siloed, and often require specialized knowledge. 

While with Jukto, businesses can:

- **Connect** live data from Databricks, Trino, BigQuery, Snowflake, CSV/XLSX, and many more.
- **Analyze** using SQL, Python, and Agentic queries in natural language
- **Visualize** dynamic drag-and-drop dashboard and actionable insight generation (table, chart, etc.)
- **Automate** alerts, schedule reports, and a fully autonomous agentic workflow for automation
- **Collaboration** with teams in real-time, share, and publish dashboards seamlessly

  > A unified multi-player workspace to act faster with confidence to make business decisions.

**The Opportunity**

We (**Jukto**) become the *platform of choice* for modern enterprises/organizations to scale analytics, automated reporting, and turn any data into their strategic advantage to grow business when data-driven decision-making is critical. We are constantly improving Jukto to **make workflows more useful, deliver insights faster, and create a better experience** for users to self-serve, with the goal of making **Jukto** the standard platform for AI-driven data operations.

# **System of Action Manifesto**
## *Jukto - AI-native Self-Serve Collaborative Data OS*  
### *Turn raw data into collective intelligence*

---

We didn't build Jukto because we love dashboards.  
We built it because we were tired of watching brilliant teams waste 20+ hours a week buried under broken pipelines, disconnected tools, and endless dashboards.  

Ask any Analyst, Engineer, or Decision-maker:

*"I‚Äôm drowning in dashboards and emails. I know the data is there somewhere, but no one has time to turn it into insights."*

So we started over.  

---

Jukto is not a BI tool.  
Not a notebook.  
Not another dashboard.  

**Jukto is the first true Collaborative Data OS**  
A place where **humans and AI reason together**, live, and act in real-time.  

---

Your queries? Already contextualized.  
Your reports? Already interactive.  
Your insights? Already actionable.  

**Jukto** handles the heavy lifting, so your team can focus on **decisions, not chores**.  

This is not about pretty charts/dashboards.  
It‚Äôs about turning data into action, so your team spends less time managing numbers and more time **building, growing, and leading**.
Because no one became a data scientist, analyst, or engineer to babysit broken tools.  

---

We‚Äôve talked to teams stuck in silos, slowed down by approvals, or buried in spreadsheets.
The giants had decades to fix this. They didn't.  
They promised clarity but delivered busywork, then called it **progress**. 

We are not a plugin.  
We are not a prettier report.  
We exist so your team stops **wasting 20+ hours a week** on endless spreadsheets, broken pipelines, and clicking between ten different tools.

---

Traditional tools ask:

*"Did you finish your data chores today?"*  

Jukto asks:

**"What decision will you make today? We‚Äôll handle the rest."**  

This is not software.  
This is liberation.  
This is **the operating system your team deserves**.  

---

We are builders who have lived the chaos.  
We‚Äôve broken pipelines, lost nights to dashboards, and questioned every tool we used.  
Now we are building **the OS we always wished existed**.  

If you‚Äôve ever said:

*"I could move faster if my tools got out of my way"*  

‚Äîthis is for you.  

Join us. Be part of building the future of collaborative intelligence.

You‚Äôll hear directly from us.  
No sales pitch.  
Just builders who care.  
And you will help shape **what comes next**.
