We are building a next-generation real-time agentic engine platform where agents can collaborate and autonomously do multi-step reasoning to automate daily tasks.

🚀 **What we do**:  
- Developing an AI-powered autonomous agentic engine that is capable of doing **reasoning like a human expert, support collaboration, and multi-step reasoning** to automate the task workflow.  
- Built with SwarmSync **a vertical multi-agentic platform**, that enables AI teams to work independently.  
- Support different integrations and MCP tools such as GitHub, Linear, JIRA, Notion, etc.

</p>


Welcome to learn about our open-source **SwarmSync-SDK** project, where we are building **AI-powered agent swarms** that collaborate like human teams. Our vertical multi-agent swarms can autonomously handle complex tasks such as software development, market research, product design, operational workflows—**10x faster** and at a fraction of the cost.

### Key Features
- **Human-Like Collaboration**: AI agents dynamically allocate tasks and make decisions as a team.
- **Vertical Swarms**: Specialized for software development, market research, operations, and more.
- **Tool Integration**: Syncs with GitHub, Linear, web browsers, and search engines for end-to-end workflows.
- **Scalable & Modular**: Build custom swarms to tackle any complex task, faster and smarter.

## Vision & Mission

**Vision**:  
To build an AI agentic platform to handle everyday tasks intelligently with our multi-agentic swarms that can think like humans and collaborate to solve real-world complex tasks at ease.

**Mission**:
To fix the current scattered AI tools into one single, easy-to-use platform where agents work together to provide automated solutions for anyone seamlessly (individuals to entire teams).
