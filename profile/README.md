## 🚀 What We’re Building

We are building a next-generation **multi-agentic intelligence platform** — an AI-native OS where agents **reason, collaborate, and act** like expert teams to work independently.

Our flagship technology, **SwarmSync**, coordinates vertical agent for:
- FinOps Automation
- Research & Development Analysis
- Other internal operations

> "Think of it as your AI-native startup team-in-a-box — collaborative agents that solve tasks just like people do."

---

## 🔒 Stealth Mode Venture

We are currently in **stealth mode**, developing an AI-native **FinOps agentic brain** that automates end-to-end financial workflows.

- ⚙️ AI-native multi-agentic brain for FinOps to autonomously manage and optimize procurement to forecasting.
- 🎯 Goal: Become the first AI CFO that never sleeps 
- 🏛 Currently on the 21-day delta program at [The Residency](https://www.livetheresidency.com/).
- 🔒 More soon.

</p>


Welcome to learn about our open-source **SwarmSync-SDK** project, where we are building **AI-powered agent swarms** that collaborate like human teams. Our vertical multi-agent swarms can autonomously handle complex tasks such as software development, market research, product design, operational workflows—**10x faster** and at a fraction of the cost.

### Key Features
- **Human-Like Collaboration**: AI agents dynamically allocate tasks and make decisions as a team.
- **Vertical Swarms**: Specialized for software development, market research, operations, and more.
- **Tool Integration**: Syncs with GitHub, Linear, web browsers, and search engines for end-to-end workflows.
- **Scalable & Modular**: Build custom swarms to tackle any complex task, faster and smarter.

## 🌍 Vision & Mission

**Vision**:  
To build an intelligent automation through **agentic AI systems** that collaborate like human teams and solve complex problems faster, cheaper, and smarter.

**Mission**:
To unify fragmented AI tools into one single, easy-to-use platform where agents work together to provide automated solutions for anyone seamlessly (individuals to entire teams).
